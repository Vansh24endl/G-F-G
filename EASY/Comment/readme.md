# Comments
Comments are very useful in any language to tell users what is the task
of any function or operation. The comments are neglected by the compiler,
so whatever you write in the comments won't have any effect on the
working of a code.
In Java, comments can be written as mentioned below:
java

// This is a comment
/* This is also a comment */
```

Comment out the line that prints the value of b.
## Examples:
```
### Example 1:
**Input:** a = 5, b = 6, c = 15
**Output:**

5
15
```

### Example 2:
```
**Input:** a = 5, b = 8, c = 15
**Output:**

5
15
```
