# ðŸ“˜ nextLine and next in Java

In this project, we will learn how to correctly take input from a string that comprises multiple words in Java. This includes understanding the **difference between `next()` and `nextLine()`** and how to **clear the input buffer** when switching between different types of input.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn
- How to read integer input
- How to read full-line string input
- Why `Scanner.nextLine()` behaves differently from `Scanner.next()`
- How to avoid common input-skipping bugs

## ðŸ§  Concept Overview

In Java, the `Scanner` class provides two commonly used methods:
- `next()` â€“ reads input **until a space**
- `nextLine()` â€“ reads the **entire line**, including spaces

When switching from `nextInt()` or `next()` to `nextLine()`, it's necessary to consume the remaining newline character (`\n`) to avoid input issues.
